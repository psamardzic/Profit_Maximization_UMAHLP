# Profit_Maximization_UMAHLP

This repository contains the materials and code for my university term paper. Below is an overview of the included files and how to use the code.

## File Structure

- **`*.txt` Files**: These files represent the input data used in the project. Each file contains specific data required for running the program.
- **`Maksimizacija_profita_UMAHLP.pdf`**: This file provides required foreknowledge, an explanation of the problem, and the results.
- **Lingo1.lg4**: This file contains the code required for calculation.

## Running the Code

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open the code file.  
2. Look for the groups of comments in the code. Each group contains several options for configuration.
3. **Uncomment one line from each group** to set up the program according to your requirements. When doing so for the **first three groups**, make sure the lines you uncomment contain the **same number** (20/25/40).
4. Save the changes and run the program.

**Important**: Ensure the required `*.txt` input files are in the correct directory before running the program.
